- [Pixel art creator](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/361743998/)-I made this cuz I love pixel art and I like the Undertale simple battle creator on scratch where you can make something so easily, hit the remix button, and it's yours. SO GOOD!!!!!!

## Night knight theme

This is the theme for when you meet Night Knight in Devil Quest chapter 2. I wanted it it to sound a little bit like the song [Undyne by Toby Fox](https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/track/undyne).

## Bomb dude theme 

This is the song for when you fight Bomb dude in Devil Quest chapter 2. I wanted it to sound happy while a crazy person was throwing bombs at you, but I covered it with FX effects so you can't really hear it.
